= Operation - Check For Firmware Updates
:toc: preamble

A check for firmware updates can be performed by sending an empty HTTP POST to `/api/edge/operation/refresh-fw-latest-status.json`.

It does not support a HTTP GET.

This method is CSRF protected so also requires a `X-CSRF-TOKEN` (see link:../README.adoc#Sensitive-Requests-CSRF-Protection[Sensitive Requests (CSRF Protection)]).
