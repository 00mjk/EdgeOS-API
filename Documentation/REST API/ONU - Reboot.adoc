= ONU - Reboot
:toc: preamble

The Optical Network Unit (ONU) can be rebooted by sending a HTTP POST to `/api/edge/onu/reboot.json`

It does not support a HTTP GET.

This method is CSRF protected so also requires a `X-CSRF-TOKEN` (see link:../README.adoc#Sensitive-Requests-CSRF-Protection[Sensitive Requests (CSRF Protection)]).
