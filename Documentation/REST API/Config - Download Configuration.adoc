= Config - Download Configuration

To download the configuration send a HTTP GET to `/api/edge/config/save.json`:

[source,json]
----
{"CONFIG": {"success": "1", "path": "/tmp/sysd-save.ycYPpL"}, "success": true}
----

and then make a request to `/files/config/`. The file will be deleted once the request has been made.
