= Operation - Shutdown

The device can be shutdown by sending a HTTP POST to `/api/edge/operation/shutdown.json`.

It does not support a HTTP GET.

This method is CSRF protected so also requires a `X-CSRF-TOKEN` (see link:../README.adoc#Sensitive-Requests-CSRF-Protection[Sensitive Requests (CSRF Protection)]).
