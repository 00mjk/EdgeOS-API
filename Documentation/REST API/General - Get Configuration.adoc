= General - Get Configuration

A HTTP GET to `/api/edge/get.json` can be used to get a pre-defined JSON formatted dictionary containing the configuration (and the current `SESSION_ID`) of the following:

* firewall
* interfaces
* layer2
* service
* system
* vpn
* protocols
* traffic-control
* onu-list
* onu-profiles
* onu-policies

It is not possible to alter the returned list as it is hardcoded.
