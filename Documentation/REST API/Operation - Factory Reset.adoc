= Operation - Factory Reset

The device can be reset back to factory-default state by sending a HTTP POST to `/api/edge/operation/factory-reset.json`. This erases all user-generated files and deletes the backup firmware image.

It does not support a HTTP GET.

This method is CSRF protected so also requires a `X-CSRF-TOKEN` (see link:../README.adoc#Sensitive-Requests-CSRF-Protection[Sensitive Requests (CSRF Protection)]).
